# Test Renderer for React

## Project Overview

**Test Renderer for React** is a lightweight, pure JavaScript testing library for React 19. It serves as a modern replacement for the deprecated `react-test-renderer`. By leveraging `react-reconciler`, it provides a custom renderer that outputs to a lightweight, traversable object structure (`HostElement`), making it ideal for snapshot testing and asserting component output without requiring a browser environment (DOM) or native dependencies.

### Key Features

- **React 19 Ready:** Built to support modern React features, including concurrent rendering.
- **Lightweight & Universal:** No DOM or native dependencies; runs in any JavaScript environment (Node.js, Bun, etc.).
- **Type-Safe:** Written in strict TypeScript.
- **Snapshot Friendly:** Produces clean JSON output for Jest/Vitest snapshots.

### Architecture

- **`src/renderer.ts`**: The main entry point. Exports `createRoot` which initializes the custom React reconciler.
- **`src/reconciler.ts`**: Implements the `react-reconciler` host config, translating React updates into operations on the internal tree.
- **`src/host-element.ts`**: Defines `HostElement`, a wrapper around the internal fiber nodes that provides a user-friendly, DOM-like API (e.g., `children`, `props`, `parent`).
- **`src/render-to-json.ts`**: Handles the serialization of `HostElement` trees into JSON format for snapshots.

## Building and Running

The project uses **Bun** as the preferred runtime/package manager for development scripts, although it can be installed via npm.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for consumption)
- Bun (for development scripts)

### Key Commands

| Command             | Description                                                    |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bun run build`     | Builds the project using `tsup` into `dist/` (CJS and ESM).    |
| `bun run dev`       | Runs the build in watch mode.                                  |
| `bun run test`      | Runs the test suite using `jest`.                              |
| `bun run lint`      | Runs `eslint` to check code style.                             |
| `bun run typecheck` | Runs `tsc` to verify types.                                    |
| `bun run validate`  | Runs formatting, linting, typechecking, and tests in sequence. |

## Development Conventions

- **Language:** Strict TypeScript.
- **Styling:** Code formatting is enforced by Prettier (`.prettierrc` implied by scripts).
- **Testing:** Unit tests are located in `src/__tests__/`. Tests use `jest` and `ts-jest`.
- **Linting:** ESLint is used for static analysis.
- **Git:** Commits seem to follow standard conventions (implied by `release-it`).

## Directory Structure

- `src/`: Source code.
  - `__tests__/`: Unit tests.
  - `test-utils/`: Utilities used within project tests.
- `dist/`: Compiled output (generated by build).
- `.github/`: GitHub Actions workflows for CI.

## Rules

- Avoid adding unnecessary comments
